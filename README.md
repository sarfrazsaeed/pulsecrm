This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## End-to-end tests (Playwright)

Local instructions:

- Build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```


- Start the app on port 3000 (recommended):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Install Playwright browsers (WebKit may be unsupported on macOS 12):

```bash
# If you run the server on a different port, set this when running tests:
export PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```
npx playwright install webkit
# if webkit fails, install all browsers or run in CI:
npx playwright install
```

- Run tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

CI: A GitHub Actions workflow is included at `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` which runs Playwright tests on Ubuntu (installs browsers and runs the suite). If local installs fail on macOS 12, push a branch and let CI run the tests.

Troubleshooting:

- If `npx playwright install webkit` errors with "Playwright does not support webkit on mac12", use CI or install other browsers that are supported on your machine.
- Ensure the server is reachable at the `baseURL` defined in `playwright.config.ts` (defaults to `http://localhost:3001`).
